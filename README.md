## AI-Driven Multi-Source Cyber Threat Detection System for Real-Time Security Analysis
# Problem Description
This project proposes an intelligent cybersecurity framework capable of analyzing multiple digital inputs including URLs, Android APK files, office documents, images, compressed files, and live network traffic. The system uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning techniques to classify inputs as safe or malicious while also identifying entities that are safe but involve third-party components that may pose privacy or security risks. The system additionally performs real-time intrusion detection to identify ongoing cyber attacks and generate timely alerts.
# Objectives
The system analyzes URLs, APK files, documents, images, and ZIP files to detect malware, hidden threats, and third-party risks. It monitors real-time network traffic using AI-based intrusion detection to identify ongoing cyber attacks. Deep learning models classify inputs accurately, while Generative AI provides explainable threat insights and security recommendations, reducing false positives and improving overall detection effectiveness.
# Proposed Solution
The system combines cybersecurity, deep learning, and Generative AI to detect malware, anomalies, and third-party risks in URLs, APKs, documents, and network traffic. CNN, LSTM, and Autoencoders ensure accurate detection, while Generative AI provides explainable threat insights and recommendations. Comparative experiments show high accuracy, low false positives, and effective real-time cyber attack detection. Also it have draft research paper.
