 2. Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of internet-based systems, cyber attacks such as malware,
phishing, ransomware, and DDoS have become more frequent and complex.
Traditional signature-based security systems fail to detect new and unknown
attacks (zero-day attacks). Hence, there is a need for intelligent and adaptive
cyber threat detection systems that can work in real time.

 3. Objectives of the Paper
- To design a deep learning-based cyber threat detection system  
- To detect both known and unknown cyber attacks  
- To improve detection accuracy compared to traditional systems  
- To reduce false positive alerts  
- To provide real-time security monitoring  



 4. Existing System
The existing cyber threat detection systems mainly use:
- Signature-based detection
- Rule-based intrusion detection
- Traditional machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest

 Limitations of Existing System:
- Cannot detect zero-day attacks
- Requires manual feature engineering
- Poor performance in real-time environments
- Less adaptive to evolving cyber threats



 5. Proposed System
The proposed system uses deep learning models such as:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

These models automatically learn patterns from network traffic and system logs.
The system can detect malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks in real time with
higher accuracy and fewer false positives.



 6. Dataset Used
- Network traffic data
- System log data
- Data includes both normal and malicious activities
- Dataset is preprocessed to remove noise and normalize features


 7. Methodology
The methodology of the system includes the following steps:
1. Collection of network traffic and system logs
2. Data preprocessing (noise removal and normalization)
3. Feature extraction using deep learning models
4. Training CNN, RNN, or LSTM models
5. Classification of traffic as normal or malicious
6. Performance evaluation using standard metrics



 8. Deep Learning Models Used
| Model | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| CNN | Feature extraction from traffic patterns |
| RNN | Sequential data analysis |
| LSTM | Detection of long-term attack patterns |


 9. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the system is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

The proposed deep learning approach outperforms traditional methods in detecting
both known and zero-day attacks.



 10. Key Findings
- Deep learning models can effectively detect cyber threats
- Automatic feature learning improves detection accuracy
- System reduces false positive rates
- Capable of real-time cyber threat detection



 11. Limitations
- Requires large datasets for training
- High computational cost
- Vulnerable to adversarial attacks



 12. Relevance to Our Project
This paper provides a strong foundation for our project:
- Helps understand AI-based intrusion detection systems
- Supports the use of CNN, LSTM, and RNN models
- Useful for designing real-time cyber threat detection frameworks



 13. Conclusion
The paper concludes that deep learning-based cyber threat detection systems
provide a robust and adaptive solution to modern cybersecurity challenges.
Compared to traditional approaches, deep learning improves accuracy, detects
unknown attacks, and enhances real-time security monitoring.



 14. Future Scope
- Integration of explainable AI for better threat interpretation
- Use of Generative AI for security recommendations
- Deployment in real-world large-scale networks
